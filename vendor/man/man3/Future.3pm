\&    on_complete => sub {
\&       $future\->done( @_ );

.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR object represents an operation that is currently in progress, or
has recently completed. It can be used in a variety of ways to manage the flow
of control, and data, through an asynchronous program.
.PP
Some futures represent a single operation and are explicitly marked as ready
by calling the \f(CW\*(C`done\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`fail\*(C'\fR methods. These are called \*(L"leaf\*(R" futures
here, and are returned by the \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR constructor.
.PP
Other futures represent a collection of sub-tasks, and are implicitly marked
as ready depending on the readiness of their component futures as required.
These are called \*(L"convergent\*(R" futures here as they converge control and
data-flow back into one place. These are the ones returned by the various
\&\f(CW\*(C`wait_*\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`need_*\*(C'\fR constructors.
.PP
It is intended that library functions that perform asynchronous operations
would use future objects to represent outstanding operations, and allow their
calling programs to control or wait for these operations to complete. The
implementation and the user of such an interface would typically make use of
different methods on the class. The methods below are documented in two
sections; those of interest to each side of the interface.
.PP
It should be noted however, that this module does not in any way provide an
actual mechanism for performing this asynchronous activity; it merely provides
a way to create objects that can be used for control and data flow around
those operations. It allows such code to be written in a neater,
forward-reading manner, and simplifies many common patterns that are often
involved in such situations.
.PP
See also Future::Utils which contains useful loop-constructing functions,
to run a future-returning function repeatedly in a loop.
.SS "\s-1SUBCLASSING\s0"
.IX Subsection "SUBCLASSING"
This class easily supports being subclassed to provide extra behavior, such as
giving the \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR method the ability to block and wait for completion. This
may be useful to provide \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR subclasses with event systems, or similar.
.PP
Each method that returns a new future object will use the invocant to
construct its return value. If the constructor needs to perform per-instance
setup it can override the \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR method, and take context from the given
instance.
.PP
.Vb 4
\& sub new
\& {
\&    my $proto = shift;
\&    my $self = $proto\->SUPER::new;
\&
\&    if( ref $proto ) {

\&    }
\&    else {
\&       # Prototype was a class
\&    }
\&
\&    return $self;
\& }
.Ve
.PP
If an instance provides a method called \f(CW\*(C`await\*(C'\fR, this will be called by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`failure\*(C'\fR methods if the instance is pending.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $f\->await
.Ve
.PP
In most cases this should allow future-returning modules to be used as if they
were blocking call/return\-style modules, by simply appending a \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR call to
the function or method calls.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& my ( $results, $here ) = future_returning_function( @args )\->get;
.Ve
.PP
The \fIexamples\fR directory in the distribution contains some examples of how
futures might be integrated with various event systems.
.SS "\s-1MODULE DOCUMENTATION\s0"
.IX Subsection "MODULE DOCUMENTATION"
Modules that provide future-returning functions or methods may wish to adopt
the following styles in some way, to document the eventual return values from
these futures.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& func( ARGS, HERE... ) ==> ( RETURN, VALUES... )
\&
\& OBJ\->method( ARGS, HERE... ) ==> ( RETURN, VALUES... )

Code returning a future that yields no values on success can use empty
parentheses.

.Ve
.SS "\s-1DEBUGGING\s0"
.IX Subsection "DEBUGGING"
By the time a \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR object is destroyed, it ought to have been completed
or cancelled. By enabling debug tracing of objects, this fact can be checked.
If a future object is destroyed without having been completed or cancelled, a
warning message is printed.
.PP
.Vb 2
\& $ PERL_FUTURE_DEBUG=1 perl \-MFuture \-E \*(Aqmy $f = Future\->new\*(Aq
\& Future=HASH(0xaa61f8) was constructed at \-e line 1 and was lost near \-e line 0 before it was ready.
.Ve
.PP
Note that due to a limitation of perl's \f(CW\*(C`caller\*(C'\fR function within a \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR
destructor method, the exact location of the leak cannot be accurately
determined. Often the leak will occur due to falling out of scope by returning
from a function; in this case the leak location may be reported as being the
line following the line calling that function.
.PP
.Vb 4
\& $ PERL_FUTURE_DEBUG=1 perl \-MFuture
\& sub foo {
\&    my $f = Future\->new;
\& }
\&
\& foo();
\& print "Finished\en";
\&
\& Future=HASH(0x14a2220) was constructed at \- line 2 and was lost near \- line 6 before it was ready.
\& Finished
.Ve
.PP
A warning is also printed in debug mode if a \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR object is destroyed
that completed with a failure, but the object believes that failure has not
been reported anywhere.
.PP
.Vb 2
\& $ PERL_FUTURE_DEBUG=1 perl \-Mblib \-MFuture \-E \*(Aqmy $f = Future\->fail("Oops")\*(Aq
\& Future=HASH(0xac98f8) was constructed at \-e line 1 and was lost near \-e line 0 with an unreported failure of: Oops
.Ve
.PP
Such a failure is considered reported if the \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`failure\*(C'\fR methods are
called on it, or it had at least one \f(CW\*(C`on_ready\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`on_fail\*(C'\fR callback, or
its failure is propagated to another \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR instance (by a sequencing or
converging method).

Returns a new \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR instance to represent a leaf future. It will be marked
as ready by any of the \f(CW\*(C`done\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`fail\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`cancel\*(C'\fR methods. It can be
called either as a class method, or as an instance method. Called on an
instance it will construct another in the same class, and is useful for
subclassing.

This constructor would primarily be used by implementations of asynchronous
interfaces.

.ie n .SS "$future = Future\->wrap( @values )"
.el .SS "\f(CW$future\fP = Future\->wrap( \f(CW@values\fP )"
.IX Subsection "$future = Future->wrap( @values )"
If given a single argument which is already a \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR reference, this will
be returned unmodified. Otherwise, returns a new \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR instance that is
already complete, and will yield the given values.
.PP
This will ensure that an incoming argument is definitely a \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR, and may
be useful in such cases as adapting synchronous code to fit asynchronous
libraries driven by \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR.

A convenient wrapper for calling a \f(CW\*(C`CODE\*(C'\fR reference that is expected to
return a future. In normal circumstances is equivalent to
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $future = $code\->( @args )
.Ve
.PP
except that if the code throws an exception, it is wrapped in a new immediate
fail future. If the return value from the code is not a blessed \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR
reference, an immediate fail future is returned instead to complain about this
fact.

Marks that the leaf future is now ready, and provides a list of values as a
result. (The empty list is allowed, and still indicates the future as ready).
Cannot be called on a convergent future.

Marks that the leaf future has failed, and provides an exception value. This
exception will be thrown by the \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR method if called.
.PP
The exception must evaluate as a true value; false exceptions are not allowed.
Further details may be provided that will be returned by the \f(CW\*(C`failure\*(C'\fR method
in list context. These details will not be part of the exception string raised
by \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR.

A convenient wrapper around \f(CW\*(C`fail\*(C'\fR. If the exception is a non-reference that

If the future is ready and completed successfully, returns the list of
results that had earlier been given to the \f(CW\*(C`done\*(C'\fR method on a leaf future,
or the list of component futures it was waiting for on a convergent future. In
scalar context it returns just the first result value.

If the future is ready but failed, this method raises as an exception the
failure string or object that was given to the \f(CW\*(C`fail\*(C'\fR method.

If the future was cancelled an exception is thrown.

If it is not yet ready and is not of a subclass that provides an \f(CW\*(C`await\*(C'\fR

The following methods all return a new future to represent the combination of
its invocant followed by another action given by a code reference. The
combined activity waits for the first future to be ready, then may invoke the
code depending on the success or failure of the first, or may run it
regardless. The returned sequence future represents the entire combination of
activity.

In some cases the code should return a future; in some it should return an
immediate result. If a future is returned, the combined future will then wait
for the result of this second one. If the combinined future is cancelled, it
will cancel either the first future or the second, depending whether the first
had completed. If the code block throws an exception instead of returning a
value, the sequence future will fail with that exception as its message and no
further values.

silently dropped), this method warns in void context.

.PP
This method is invoked internally by various methods that are about to save a
callback \s-1CODE\s0 reference supplied by the user, to be invoked later. The default
implementation simply returns the callback agument as-is; the method is
provided to allow users to provide extra behaviour. This can be done by
applying a method modifier of the \f(CW\*(C`around\*(C'\fR kind, so in effect add a chain of
wrappers. Each wrapper can then perform its own wrapping logic of the
callback. \f(CW$operation_name\fR is a string giving the reason for which the
callback is being saved; currently one of \f(CW\*(C`on_ready\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`on_done\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`on_fail\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`sequence\*(C'\fR; the latter being used for all the sequence-returning methods.
.PP
This method is intentionally invoked only for \s-1CODE\s0 references that are being
saved on a pending \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR instance to be invoked at some later point. It
does not run for callbacks to be invoked on an already-complete instance. This
is for performance reasons, where the intended behaviour is that the wrapper
can provide some amount of context save and restore, to return the operating
environment for the callback back to what it was at the time it was saved.
.PP
For example, the following wrapper saves the value of a package variable at
the time the callback was saved, and restores that value at invocation time
later on. This could be useful for preserving context during logging in a
Future-based program.

At this point, any code deferred into a \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR by any of its callbacks will
observe the \f(CW$LOGGING_CTX\fR variable as having the value it held at the time
the callback was saved, even if it is invoked later on when that value is
different.
.PP
Remember when writing such a wrapper, that it still needs to invoke the
previous version of the method, so that it plays nicely in combination with
others (see the \f(CW\*(C`$orig\->( @_ )\*(C'\fR part).

arranged to put the successful case first, similar to a \f(CW\*(C`try\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR block.
.PP
Because the \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR method re-raises the passed exception if the future failed,
it can be used to control a \f(CW\*(C`try\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR block directly. (This is sometimes
called \fIException Hoisting\fR).
.PP
.Vb 1
\& use Try::Tiny;
\&
\& $f\->on_ready( sub {
\&    my $f = shift;
\&    try {
\&       say "The operation succeeded with: ", $f\->get;
\&    }
\&    catch {
\&       say "The operation failed with: ", $_;
\&    };
\& } );
.Ve
.PP
Even neater still may be the separate use of the \f(CW\*(C`on_done\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`on_fail\*(C'\fR
methods.
.PP
.Vb 8
\& $f\->on_done( sub {
\&    my @result = @_;
\&    say "The operation succeeded with: ", @result;
\& } );
\& $f\->on_fail( sub {
\&    my ( $failure ) = @_;
\&    say "The operation failed with: $failure";
\& } );
.Ve
.SS "Immediate Futures"
.IX Subsection "Immediate Futures"
Because the \f(CW\*(C`done\*(C'\fR method returns the future object itself, it can be used to
generate a \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR that is immediately ready with a result. This can also be
used as a class method.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& my $f = Future\->done( $value );
.Ve
.PP
Similarly, the \f(CW\*(C`fail\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR methods can be used to generate a \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR
that is immediately failed.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& my $f = Future\->die( "This is never going to work" );
.Ve
.PP
This could be considered similarly to a \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR call.
.PP
An \f(CW\*(C`eval{}\*(C'\fR block can be used to turn a \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR\-returning function that
might throw an exception, into a \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR that would indicate this failure.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& my $f = eval { function() } || Future\->fail( $@ );
.Ve
.PP
This is neater handled by the \f(CW\*(C`call\*(C'\fR class method, which wraps the call in
an \f(CW\*(C`eval{}\*(C'\fR block and tests the result:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& my $f = Future\->call( \e&function );
.Ve
.SS "Sequencing"
.IX Subsection "Sequencing"
The \f(CW\*(C`then\*(C'\fR method can be used to create simple chains of dependent tasks,
each one executing and returning a \f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR when the previous operation
succeeds.
.PP
.Vb 7
\& my $f = do_first()
\&            \->then( sub {
\&               return do_second();
\&            })
\&            \->then( sub {
\&               return do_third();
\&            });
.Ve
.PP
The result of the \f(CW$f\fR future itself will be the result of the future
returned by the final function, if none of them failed. If any of them fails
it will fail with the same failure. This can be considered similar to normal
exception handling in synchronous code; the first time a function call throws
an exception, the subsequent calls are not made.
.SS "Merging Control Flow"
.IX Subsection "Merging Control Flow"
A \f(CW\*(C`wait_all\*(C'\fR future may be used to resynchronise control flow, while waiting
for multiple concurrent operations to finish.
.PP
.Vb 2
\& my $f1 = foperation( foo => "something" );
\& my $f2 = foperation( bar => "something else" );
\&
\& my $f = Future\->wait_all( $f1, $f2 );
\&
\& $f\->on_ready( sub {
\&    say "Operations are ready:";
\&    say "  foo: ", $f1\->get;
\&    say "  bar: ", $f2\->get;
\& } );
.Ve
.PP
This provides an ability somewhat similar to \f(CW\*(C`CPS::kpar()\*(C'\fR or
Async::MergePoint.
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"

.SS "Cancellation of Non-Final Sequence Futures"
.IX Subsection "Cancellation of Non-Final Sequence Futures"
The behaviour of future cancellation still has some unanswered questions
regarding how to handle the situation where a future is cancelled that has a
sequence future constructed from it.
.PP
In particular, it is unclear in each of the following examples what the
behaviour of \f(CW$f2\fR should be, were \f(CW$f1\fR to be cancelled:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $f2 = $f1\->then( sub { ... } ); # plus related \->then_with_f, ...
\&
\& $f2 = $f1\->else( sub { ... } ); # plus related \->else_with_f, ...
\&
\& $f2 = $f1\->followed_by( sub { ... } );
.Ve
.PP
In the \f(CW\*(C`then\*(C'\fR\-style case it is likely that this situation should be treated
as if \f(CW$f1\fR had failed, perhaps with some special message. The \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR\-style
case is more complex, because it may be that the entire operation should still
fail, or it may be that the cancellation of \f(CW$f1\fR should again be treated
simply as a special kind of failure, and the \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR logic run as normal.
.PP
To be specific; in each case it is unclear what happens if the first future is
cancelled, while the second one is still waiting on it. The semantics for
\&\*(L"normal\*(R" top-down cancellation of \f(CW$f2\fR and how it affects \f(CW$f1\fR are already
clear and defined.
.SS "Cancellation of Divergent Flow"
.IX Subsection "Cancellation of Divergent Flow"
A further complication of cancellation comes from the case where a given
future is reused multiple times for multiple sequences or convergent trees.
.PP
In particular, it is in clear in each of the following examples what the
behaviour of \f(CW$f2\fR should be, were \f(CW$f1\fR to be cancelled:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& my $f_initial = Future\->new; ...
\& my $f1 = $f_initial\->then( ... );
\& my $f2 = $f_initial\->then( ... );
\&
\& my $f1 = Future\->needs_all( $f_initial );
\& my $f2 = Future\->needs_all( $f_initial );
.Ve
.PP
The point of cancellation propagation is to trace backwards through stages of
some larger sequence of operations that now no longer need to happen, because
the final result is no longer required. But in each of these cases, just
because \f(CW$f1\fR has been cancelled, the initial future \f(CW$f_initial\fR is still
required because there is another future (\f(CW$f2\fR) that will still require its
result.
.PP
Initially it would appear that some kind of reference-counting mechanism could
solve this question, though that itself is further complicated by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`on_ready\*(C'\fR handler and its variants.
.PP
It may simply be that a comprehensive useful set of cancellation semantics
can't be universally provided to cover all cases; and that some use-cases at
least would require the application logic to give extra information to its
\&\f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR objects on how they should wire up the cancel propagation logic.
.PP
Both of these cancellation issues are still under active design consideration;
see the discussion on \s-1RT96685\s0 for more information
(<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=96685>).

Consider the ability to pass the constructor an \f(CW\*(C`await\*(C'\fR CODEref, instead of
needing to use a subclass. This might simplify async/etc.. implementations,
and allows the reuse of the idea of subclassing to extend the abilities of
\&\f(CW\*(C`Future\*(C'\fR itself \- for example to allow a kind of Future that can report
incremental progress.
